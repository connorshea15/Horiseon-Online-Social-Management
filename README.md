# Code Refactor Starter Code

This project consists of the refactoring of starter code for the landing page for an social web services firm called Horiseon. The code has been refactored by utilizing classes to consolidate CSS rules, adding detailed comments providing context to the code, making the code accessible for screen reading technologies, and organizing the code so it is more intuitive. 

You can see a mockup of the landing page below...
